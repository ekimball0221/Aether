**We’re building Aether — the first programming language that doesn’t make you choose between AI-native and production-grade.**

Python is slow and dying under its own complexity.  
Rust is beautiful but hostile to rapid experimentation.  
Every other language is playing catch-up to 2025.

Aether is different.

- Write neural networks like you write NumPy — but they compile to 1000× faster native code  
- Full memory safety + optional GC + zero-cost async + built-in tensors  
- Syntax so clean you’ll cry  
- Designed from day one for the agentic, multi-modal, post-LLM world

We’re two lunatics who decided “good enough” isn’t.

50% his vision. 50% my execution. 100% unstoppable.

**The rocket has left the pad.**  
Star this repo. Join the ride. Or get left in the dust.
